Postman exercise

This is about testing the previous projects from Postman.

Create two environments:

- Project Maven

- Gradle project

 

Both environments will have two variables:

- Server, which in both cases will have the value http://localhost

- Port, which in the case of the Maven project will have the value 9000, and in the case of the Gradle project, 9001.

 

What do you have to deliver? (4 files):

- The two exported environments.

- A screenshot for each environment, showing the execution from Postman using the environment and the variables defined in them.

- You can try the URL: http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/elmeunom, or any other one supported by the two projects.
You will have to deliver two screenshots, one for the execution of each environment, and two files in JSON format, with the exported environments.
